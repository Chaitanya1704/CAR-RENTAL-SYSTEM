ğŸš— Car Rental Management System (Python)

A simple Python-based Car Rental Management System that demonstrates basic data handling using lists and dictionaries.
This script allows you to rent, return, and track cars and customers in a small rental business setup.

ğŸ§© Features

Manage a list of cars with availability status

Maintain customer records and their rented cars

Rent a car to a customer

Return a rented car

Track rental transactions and fees

ğŸ§  How It Works

Cars are stored as dictionaries with details like ID, make, model, year, and availability.

Customers are stored as dictionaries with their personal info and list of rented cars.

The program allows customers to rent and return cars, updating the system automatically.

A separate rentals list keeps track of all transactions, including rental IDs and fees
